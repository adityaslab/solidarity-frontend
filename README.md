## Features

- Solidarity uses Spring Security to provide secure authentication for users. Users can register, login, and logout from the application.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) used for authentication. JWT tokens are generated upon successful login and are used for subsequent API requests to authenticate and authorize users.The API is secured using JWT tokens for authentication and authorization. Solidarity implements role-based access control with two roles: Admin and User. Admins have additional privileges such as deleteting other users.
- Users can create, join, and manage tasks. Tasks have a many-to-many relationship with users, allowing multiple users to join a task. Task creators have the ability to delete tasks, mark tasks as completed, and view tasks they have
- The frontend of Solidarity is implemented using Next.js, Tailwind CSS is used for styling.
